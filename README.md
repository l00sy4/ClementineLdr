# Clementine

Clementine loader is a fresh take on and old technique. The project is still WIP, and I would love PRs!

# Description

It attempts to allocate the DLL at it's preferred address in order to avoid having to perform relocations.

The injector is planned to be simple, as it's purpose will be to show off the loader itself.
